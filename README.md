Task
Recall weekly MATLAB exercise 3-1: Using element-wise operations. Write a report on this problem using 
LaTeX in IMRAD format (introduction, methods, results, analysis, and discussion). The focus of grading is on
usage of LaTeX, not on the content or grammar. Maximum length of the .pdf -report is two pages.
Introduction is a general description of the work.
Methods describes the principles of conducting the work. The methods section must contain a mathematical
formula written with dollar ($) notation in LaTeX.
Results section must contain a graph with axes and data points plotted on it.
Analysis section must contain a table with a title and caption. You must also refer to the table within the text 
and use linking feature of LaTeX.
Discussion is a short summary of the work.
Grading principles:
1. Report must be written on the given topic (Exercise 3-1) and must contain all the heading IMRAD(pass/fail).
2. The report must have a list of references and there must be at least one inline citation of a 
reference, with a linking feature of LaTeX (1 point).
3. Methods section must include a mathematical formula in LaTeX style (1 point).
4. There must be a graph in the results section (1 point).
5. There must be a table in the analysis section with a caption (1 point).
6. There must be LaTeX style links to all tables, graphs, and references (1 point).
